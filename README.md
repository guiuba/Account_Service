Hi everyone, this is my implementation of the JetBrains Academy project Account Service, stage 7/7.

To summarize a little, at each stage new improvements were added, namely:

1- **Create the Service Structure** Develop and implement the API structure. Take a first look at the future role model.

2- **The Authentication** Add the user authentication functionality to the service.

3- **Security First!** The security department took an interest in the service! It is time to implement some requirements of security standards for the authentication procedure.

4- **Attention to Business** It's time to implement the business logic of our service.

5- **The Authorization** Finalize the role model using the Spring Security functionality and add the administrative functions.

6- **Logging Events** Log security events, detect attacks, and monitor user activities.

7- **Securing Connection** Implement the HTTPS protocol to fortify the service.
